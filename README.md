# How to run code

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `yarn start` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate` or `yarn generate` to generate a new component. (Note: React does not have a built-in code scaffolding command, but you can use tools like [Plop.js](https://plopjs.com/) for this purpose.)

## Build

Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` or `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` or `yarn e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests. (Note: React does not include end-to-end testing by default, but you can use tools like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) for this purpose.)
